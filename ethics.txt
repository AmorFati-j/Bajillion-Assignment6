Please write your response to the reflective ethics question here.

Question 1, yes, I believe that search engine companies have ethical issues
when it comes to adjusting the ranking of search results related to their interests.
This is a result that contradicts universal values. Allowing such situations to
continue as a driving force for greater benefits will only make the situation in the
internet ecosystem worse and worse. The status of users will become lower and lower,
becoming victims of capital and information manipulation. To change this situation,
first we can require search engine companies to disclose their search algorithms and
accept regulation at the legal level.
Second, we can accept feedback from users on ads placed on search engines
(of course, provided that the feedback is genuine).
However, considering the huge cost issue faced by search engine companies,
I would be willing to pay fees equivalent to my usage scenario and its value.


For the second question, I believe that the most important goal of
a search engine is to quickly provide comprehensive and authentic information
to the public. Only authentic information is fair and valuable.
In implementing Bajillion search engine, my only pursuit is for
algorithm comprehensiveness, accuracy, and speed.
